To run this simple Node program, simply enter the arguments you want to compute into the input.txt file.

Currently the file looks like this:
```
5 3
188930 194123 201345 154243 154243
```

Do not add any extra lines, commas or special characters to the input file, as this will cause potential errors in data reading.

Go to the root directory on your command line and type:
```
node index.js
```
The result should be displayed in an array.

Thanks!
